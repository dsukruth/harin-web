  By day, I'm exploring the mysteries of human cognition as a PhD candidate at the 
  <a href="https://www.cbs.mpg.de/en" target="_blank">Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences</a>, 
  where I have the privilege of working with the brilliant <a href="https://imprs-coni.mpg.de/marc-schoenwiesner" target="_blank">Marc Sch√∂nwiesner</a>.
  When I'm not there, you'll catch me at the <a href="https://www.aesthetics.mpg.de/en/research/research-group-computational-auditory-perception.html" target="_blank">Computational Auditory Perception Group</a>,
  diving into fascinating projects with incomparable <a href="https://www.norijacoby.com/" target="_blank">Nori Jacoby</a>. 
  Behind the scenes, I've been receiving stellar guidance from <a href="https://minsu-park.github.io/home/about/index.html" target="_blank">Minsu Park</a> at NYU Abu Dhabi.

  Why does K-pop sounds so different from Brazilian samba? Or why certain melodies feel familiar across continents?
  In our increasingly connected world, it's fascinating to see how some cultural elements remain distinctly local,
  like musical fingerprints of identity, while others flow more freely across borders, creating new global fusions.

  My research aims to decode various aspects of cultural patterns: from choices we make as individuals to
  how culture evolves and diffuses across cities and countries. 
  To achieve this, I combine massive datasets of music all around the world, 
  conduct large cross-cultural behavioural experiments, and develop computational models.
