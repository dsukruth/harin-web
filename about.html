  I'm a PhD candidate at the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive
  and Brain Sciences under the supervision of <a href="https://imprs-coni.mpg.de/marc-schoenwiesner" target="_blank">Marc Sch√∂nwiesner</a> and a
  visiting researcher at the <a href="https://www.aesthetics.mpg.de/en/research/research-group-computational-auditory-perception.html" target="_blank">Computational Auditory Perception Group</a>
  led by <a href="https://www.norijacoby.com/" target="_blank">Nori Jacoby</a>.

  My interests centres on cross-cultural diversity
  in music and the methods we can apply to quantify its
  characteristics. I combine datasets of music around the world with
  large-scale behavioural experiments to tackle questions about
  inter-individual and cross-cultural differences in music cognition.
  I also work on computational modelling and network analysis to study how
  music spreads among individuals through contagion but also across
  cultures through cultural diffusion.
