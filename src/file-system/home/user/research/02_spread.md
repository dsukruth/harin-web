The way ideas and information spread through society is rather fascinating. From playground crazes to viral tiktok trends, patterns of contagion follow similar rules. Whether between mates at the pub or across continents through social media, we can map how new behaviours emerge and propagate through communities.

Thanks to groundbreaking new tools like *PsyNet*, we can now run online experiments at scale that were not possible before. 

Picture an online version of Chinese whispers, we can track exactly how messages change as they pass along. We can even create miniature virtual societies to observe how people's interactions shape group behaviour. By combining these clever experiments with real-world data, we're beginning to understand how ideas and cultural trends catch on and spread.
