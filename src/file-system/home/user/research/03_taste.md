Why do some songs just click with us while others don't? Or why certain paintings are more appealing to look at? When you and another person share the same taste in music, do you also tend to like the same films or clothes? 

Truth is, we're still trying to figure out exactly how our tastes work, and whether liking one thing means we'll like something similar in a different area.

By analysing real-world behavioural patterns and asking people what they like across multiple domains, I try to understand how our environment and experiences shape our tastes, and explore whether our aesthetic preferences remain consistent across different cultural categories like music, colour, and art.
