## *Harin Lee*

I'm a PhD candidate at the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences under the supervision of Marc Sch√∂nwiesner and a visiting researcher at the Computational Auditory Perception Group led by Nori Jacoby.

My interests centres on cross-cultural diversity in music and the methods we can apply to quantify its characteristics. I combine datasets of music around the world with large-scale behavioural experiments to tackle questions about inter-individual and cross-cultural differences in music cognition. I also work on computational modelling and network analysis to study how music spreads among individuals through contagion but also across cultures through cultural diffusion.
